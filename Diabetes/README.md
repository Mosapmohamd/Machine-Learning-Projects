# Diabetes Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on medical input data using machine learning.

## Project Overview
The goal is to use supervised learning algorithms to classify whether a person is likely to have diabetes. The dataset includes features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and others.
