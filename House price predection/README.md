# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques, based on features such as the number of rooms, location, and other housing-related attributes.

## Project Overview
The project leverages a dataset containing housing features and prices, applies data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, and builds regression models to predict house prices.
